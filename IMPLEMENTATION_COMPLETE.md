# Email Subscription System - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Built

A complete email subscription system that integrates with the existing subscribe form in the website footer (visible on Blog and Career pages).

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. User Subscribes

- User enters email in the footer subscribe form (Blog/Career pages)
- Email is sent to `/api/subscribe` endpoint
- Email is validated for correct format
- If valid and not a duplicate, saved to MongoDB with timestamp

### 2. Admin Creates Blog/Career

- Admin uploads new blog → all subscribers get notification email
- Admin posts new career → all subscribers get notification email
- Emails sent one-by-one with rate limiting
- Non-blocking (won't delay admin's API response)

### 3. Subscribers Receive Email

- Professional HTML formatted emails
- Blog email has "Read More" button
- Career email has "View Job Details" button with job location and requirements
- Each email has unsubscribe option

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Create `.env` file in `Contact-backend/`:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CONTACT_EMAIL=your_email@company.com
WEBSITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/Visiomatix
```

### 2. Start Backend Server

```bash
cd Contact-backend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Subscribe Form

- Go to `/blog` or `/careers` page
- Scroll to footer
- Enter email in "Stay ahead of the curve" section
- Click Subscribe
- Should see success popup

### 4. Test Blog Notification

```bash
# Admin creates blog → all subscribers get email
```

## 📊 Database

The existing `Subscriber` model in `Contact-backend/models/Subscriber.js` includes:

- `email` - unique, lowercase, trimmed, validated
- `subscribedAt` - auto timestamp
- `isActive` - for tracking unsubscribes

## 🧪 API Endpoints

**Subscribe (Public)**

```
POST /api/subscribe
{"email": "user@example.com"}
```

**Unsubscribe (Public)**

```
POST /api/subscribe/unsubscribe
{"email": "user@example.com"}
```

**Get Subscribers (Admin)**

```
GET /api/subscribe
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN
```

## 📧 Email Templates

### Blog Email

- Title: Blog post title
- Image: Blog cover image
- Date: Publication date
- Preview: First 200 characters of description
- Button: "Read More" → `/blog`

### Career Email

- Title: Job title
- Image: Job image if available
- Location: Job location

## ✨ Key Points

1. **Uses existing UI** - Integrates with homepage footer subscribe form
2. **Automatic emails** - No manual action needed after blog/career creation
3. **Non-blocking** - Email errors won't prevent blog/career creation
4. **Rate limited** - 100ms delay between emails prevents API throttling
5. **Email validated** - Invalid emails rejected before storing
6. **Duplicates prevented** - Same email can't subscribe twice
7. **Admin accessible** - Admins can view subscriber list
8. **Unsubscribe ready** - Users can unsubscribe at any time

## 📝 Files to Edit for Customization

1. **Email content** → Edit `Contact-backend/utils/emailService.js`
2. **Validation rules** → Edit `Contact-backend/controllers/subscribeController.js`
3. **Form styling** → Edit `src/components/Home/HomePage9/index.css`
4. **Form behavior** → Edit `src/components/Home/HomePage9/index.jsx`

## 🐛 Debugging

Check backend console for:

- "Email sent to user@example.com" - successful sends
- "Failed to send email to..." - failed sends
- "Blog notification emails sent: { success: true, sent: X, failed: Y }"
- MongoDB connection status
